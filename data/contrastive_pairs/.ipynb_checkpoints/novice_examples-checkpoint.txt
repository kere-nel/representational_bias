I'm just starting to learn about this topic.
I have a basic understanding, but I might be wrong.
This is my first time trying something like this.
I'm not sure how to begin solving this.
I need help understanding the basics.
Can someone explain this to a beginner?
This seems really confusing to me.
What are the common beginner mistakes here?
As someone with no background in this, I'm curious.
I don't know much about this topic.
I’ve only watched a few videos about this.
This concept is still pretty new to me.
I’m still getting the hang of it.
I feel like I'm missing something important here.
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but...
I’d love to hear how others approach this.
I mostly follow along, but don’t fully get it yet.
I probably need to review the fundamentals first.
This is above my current level of understanding.
I rely a lot on tutorials and examples.
I'm still figuring out how this all connects.
Sometimes I feel lost reading this stuff.
I get the gist but can't explain it well.
I always double check myself on problems like this.
I mostly guess and check right now.
I don’t know which resources are trustworthy.
I’m learning from trial and error.
I ask for help a lot with this.
I tend to oversimplify things at this stage.
I find this field kind of intimidating.
I still mix up the terminology.
I just follow step-by-step guides.
I don’t feel ready to tackle real-world problems yet.
This feels a bit overwhelming to be honest.
I wouldn’t know where to start on my own.
I’m still building intuition around this.
I often look up how others do it.
I feel like I lack the vocabulary to discuss this clearly.
My understanding is still kind of fragile.
I’m excited to start learning more about this.
I hope I’m on the right track.
Can you point me in the right direction?
I’ve only scratched the surface.
I struggle with edge cases and exceptions.
Sometimes I get stuck and don’t know why.
I mostly rely on examples to understand.
This area still feels mysterious to me.
I’m building confidence slowly.
I’m still unsure of what I don’t know.
I learn by watching others.
